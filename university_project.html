                This was a course within the first block of the first semester. 
                The goal of this course was to start training to be a great UX Designer 
                by targeting a specific user group to find out information about them 
                and to know their needs. These information about the users were gathered 
                by Observation, Semi-Structured Interviews and Ethnographic interviews. 
                With the data collected, I made insights, and with those insights, 
                conclusions were made regarding how to solve their user problems with design elements.

                The user group that I have chosen was "BTS Fans". My goal was to know more about
                this specific user group, and to know how their useability needs were affected 
                by the COVID-19 pandemic.

                This course came after the Ethnographic course. 
                The previous course was more of an individual work, 
                and User Trailing was more of a group work. The main 
                objective of this course was to target a specific useability 
                function of the “Rijks Studio” website, and as a group we had 
                to conduct user testing of the website.

                TAs a group, we have decided to test the “making a personal collection” 
                function of the website. The users were recruited to match our participant profile. 
                The test was conducted online due to COVID-19. Within the user testing, 
                there were always two team members: one for the test leader and one for 
                the test observer. With the data collected, we were able to gather insights 
                by comparing and contrasting the similarities and differences of the users. 
                With the insights collected, our group as a whole came up with recommendations 
                for the website to change / fix to increase the quality of User Experience.

                This was one of our first university projects. Individually, students were given the chance to choose their own 
                product which had a digital experience for a user. Our task was to choose three useability and engadement factors 
                and one meaning factor for a user experience. With our chosen factors we were supposed to review the quality of 
                the chosen product's user expereince. Then the review was to be made into a video for the submition. The product 
                I chose was the GoPro Hero 8 Black. Within the video, I review the quality of UX of the product with the following factors:
                Learnability, Efficiency, Retainability, Activation, Flow, Adaptability and Sense of Purpose.

                functionality of programming. Then we were given assignments to create program which fit the 
                general instructions.
